                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>I'm an associate professor in Computer Science at Karlstad University. With a passion for both teaching and research, 
                        I currently instruct courses on Operating Systems, Computer Networking, and Internet of Things (IoT). 
                        My research interests lie in the field of low latency networking, web performance, mobile broadband (MBB) networks, 
                        including 5G and beyond, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

                        European Union projects such as RITE, MONROE, NEAT and 5GENESIS. Currently, I serve as a subproject leader in the DRIVE project. 
                        I continue to push the boundaries of computer science research and is dedicated to providing students with a comprehensive education in the field.</p>
